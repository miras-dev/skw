 * 37 rungs, Unranked (105000000) to Legend I (105000036), and the id encodes the
 * position: `id - 105000000` is the rank. That makes cross-player comparison
 * ordinal and exact, Legend III outranks Electro 33 by id alone, no thresholds
 * needed.
 *
 * What the endpoint does NOT give is trophy cutoffs per tier, so trophies and
 * placement are only comparable BETWEEN players when the tier matches. Rank on
 * the tier first; use trophies to break ties inside one tier.
 *
 * The table is inlined rather than fetched because the pages load as plain
 * scripts with no build step, and a badge that pops in after a round-trip is
 * worse than one that is simply there. data/leaguetiers.json holds the verbatim
 * API response this was generated from, re-fetch that endpoint and regenerate
 * if Supercell ever changes the ladder.

 * the ladder produces far worse raw numbers. Scoring raw form therefore ranks
 * the strongest attackers LAST, which is precisely backwards for CWL, where

 * priority bands and the roster is filled band by band, best form first inside

 *   3  Strong attackers in Legend II or III who are not maxed: form carries
 *      them even where the base does not.
 *   4  Everyone else, by form.
 *
 * The API exposes NO defensive building levels, no walls, no defence levels,
 * nothing that says "supercharged", so band 2 uses hero sum as the maxing
 * proxy and, where we have enough defences on record, how often the player is
 * actually three-starred. The second signal is the better one: two players at
